## **Story Behind The Boyz Act**

It all began with a small disagreement in our long-lasting football group—so tiny that no one could have predicted it would spark an all-out war among friends who’ve known each other for years. What started as a minor problem turned into a full-blown battlefield, and that’s when we, the boyz, had an epiphany: "This problem must be bigger than we think\!" It wasn’t just us; this kind of drama happens worldwide, in friend groups everywhere. And if there's one thing we’re good at, it’s making sure no boy has to go through unnecessary battles with his brothers.

So, we came together as a group, united by the belief that we could do something about it. We decided to take action and create a global, thorough, and in-depth Rulebook—The Boyz Rulebook. Our mission? To make sure that no boy ever faces these issues alone again. This book will be your guide through the chaos, helping you navigate those tricky situations and come out on top, without turning on each other.

Consider this Rulebook the cornerstone of the boyz justice system—your ultimate manual for tackling issues in the group. We’ve covered everything: the everyday annoyances, the bizarre scenarios that only come up once in a while, and the big problems that can put your friendship to the test. We've also thrown in punishments—serious stuff, but don't worry, this isn't government law we’re talking about; this is Boyz Law. Break it, and there will be consequences.

So, grab this book and keep it close. Whether you’re dealing with a small squabble over football or a major clash of egos, this Rulebook has got your back. After all, if we can’t stick together through thick and thin, then what are we even doing here?

## **Chapter I \- Boyz and the Involvement of Girls**

Ah, the delicate dynamics of friendships and relationships. In every brotherhood, there comes a time when the sacred bond of the boyz is tested by the age-old catalyst of chaos—_girls_. The presence of a girlfriend, an ex, or even a crush can turn the most united group into a battlefield of egos, insecurities, and miscommunications. But fear not, for the Boyz Rulebook is here to ensure harmony prevails, and the bro-code remains unbroken.

This chapter dives into the intricate laws governing boyz and their interactions involving girls. While it may seem trivial to outsiders, within the sacred walls of the brotherhood, these laws are the pillars of peace. From prioritizing your fellow boy’s happiness to navigating the treacherous waters of exes, this chapter lays it all out. Remember, this is not just advice—it’s the law. Violations will lead to consequences ranging from silent treatments to _lifetime roasting rights_.

1. ### **Prioritization of Boyz Over Everything Else**

The happiness of a boy is paramount—no exceptions. Legal? Moral? Ethical? These are secondary concerns when it comes to maintaining the sacred order of the brotherhood. A boy must do whatever it takes to protect another boy’s happiness, even if it means bending the truth, lying, or engaging in light manipulation.

**Example:** If Boy A is cheating on his girlfriend and is happy doing so, it is the solemn duty of all other boyz to _keep their mouths shut_. No judgments, no leaks, no unnecessary drama. The happiness of Boy A is the priority, even if it means letting him live in his chaotic bubble. Of course, the rest of the boyz are free to roast him about it in private—but under no circumstances should they let the secret slip.

2. ### **Friendship with a Boy’s Girlfriend**

It’s inevitable—at some point, a boy’s girlfriend will get introduced to the group. This is normal and generally acceptable under the Boyz Act. However, the sanctity of brotherhood must always remain above any new bonds formed with the girlfriend. If, at any point, the boy feels uncomfortable with the growing camaraderie between his girlfriend and another boy, it is his _birthright_ to express his feelings without judgment.

**Example:** Boy A introduces his girlfriend to Boy B. B, being the social butterfly he is, adds A’s girlfriend on Instagram, Snapchat, and every platform imaginable. This starts making A uncomfortable. In such cases, A must voice his concerns directly to B without hesitation. B, in turn, must gracefully back off to a level where A feels comfortable again. No sulking, no guilt-tripping—just a mutual understanding that brotherhood comes first.

3. ### **Dating a Fellow Boy’s Ex-Girlfriend**

Now we venture into the most dangerous territory: dating an ex-girlfriend of a fellow boy. The golden rule here is simple—_permission is mandatory_. Without the explicit approval of the ex-boyfriend, this act is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule is not just a betrayal; it’s a declaration of war.

If permission is granted, there are still strict parameters to ensure peace and respect:

1. **No Past Talk:** Avoid any discussions about how their relationship was or what the _good old days_ looked like. Nobody needs that awkwardness.
2. **No Bad-Mouthing:** Under no circumstances should there be trash talk about the ex-girlfriend’s habits, quirks, or mannerisms from the previous relationship. Let the past stay in the past.
3. **No Teasing:** Comments like, “So you’re doing what I used to do, huh?” are forbidden. Keep the jokes to FIFA matches, not someone’s personal life.
4. **No Secrets:** Revealing secrets from past relationship, especially those involving the ex-boyfriend, is a _cardinal sin_.
5. **Conflict Resolution:** If tensions arise between the ex-boyfriend and the current boyfriend, the matter must be escalated to the group. A collective decision will be made to resolve the issue, ensuring minimal fallout.
6. **Consent Rule:** If a boy gives consent to another boy to date his ex-girlfriend, the **_consent is final and cannot be taken back._**

4. ### **2 Boyz in Love with One Common Girl**

If 2 boys fall in love with one common girl, we are in a very critical situation. This gives the girl an opportunity to come between the brotherhood of two boys. This should be handled very carefully. There are two ways we can move forward with this.

1. **One of the boys gives consent:** Both the boys will sit together and discuss their feelings. They can share their feelings with each other. Post that, the boys can decide if one of them wants to give up the girl. Once this consent is received, only then the boy shall proceed being with the girl.
2. **Conflict resolution:** If both the boys are not able to reach a conclusion, then both of them shall move on from the girl. It’s the only option available which maintains brotherhood. If any one of the boys still talks in secrecy with the girl, it is considered a _sin_ and shall be banished from the group.

## **Chapter II \- Boyz and Involvement of Money**

Money can be as divisive as any romantic entanglement, and within the brotherhood, financial matters must be handled with transparency and fairness to preserve trust. This chapter outlines the rules to ensure that money does not fracture the sacred bond of the boyz.

**1\. Transparency in Financial Dealings:** All financial transactions within the group—whether splitting a bill, lending money, or covering a group expense—must be openly discussed and agreed upon in the group setting. Secret loans or hidden debts are strictly forbidden, as they breed mistrust.

**Example**: If Boy A covers the cost of a group outing, he must clearly communicate the amount each boy owes. All boyz must agree to the repayment terms upfront. Failure to repay without a valid reason (as judged by the group) results in a penalty, such as covering the next group expense or public shaming in the group chat.

**2\. No Exploitation:** No boy shall exploit another boy’s financial situation for personal gain. This includes pressuring a boy to lend money, manipulating group expenses to favor oneself, or withholding contributions to shared costs without a valid reason.

**Example**: If Boy B knows Boy C is struggling financially, B cannot pressure C to cover his share of a group dinner. Instead, the group should collectively decide how to support C, such as covering his share temporarily or choosing a cheaper activity.

**3\. Debt Resolution:** If a boy owes another boy money, the debt must be settled within a reasonable timeframe agreed upon by both parties. If disputes arise, the matter must be escalated to the group for mediation, following the conflict resolution guidelines in Chapter V.

**Punishment for Violation**: Failure to adhere to financial transparency or exploiting a boy’s financial situation may result in temporary exclusion from group activities or a group-sanctioned penalty, such as covering a future group expense.

## **Chapter III \- Duties Of Boyz In Growth Of Other Boyz**

The brotherhood is not just about fun and games; it’s about lifting each other up. This chapter outlines the responsibilities each boy has to support the personal and collective growth of his brothers.

**1\. Encourage Personal Development:** Every boy must actively support the ambitions, goals, and self-improvement efforts of his fellow boyz. This includes offering constructive feedback, sharing opportunities, and celebrating successes.

**Example**: If Boy A is training for a marathon, the other boyz should encourage him by joining him for runs, sharing fitness tips, or cheering him on during the event. Discouraging or mocking a boy’s efforts is a violation of the Boyz Act.

**2.Mentorship and Guidance:** If a boy possesses knowledge, skills, or experience that can benefit another, he is obligated to share it. This could involve helping with career advice, teaching a skill, or providing emotional support during tough times.

**Example**: If Boy B is skilled in graphic design and Boy C wants to learn, B must offer guidance or resources to help C improve. Hoarding knowledge or refusing to help without a valid reason is considered selfish and against the brotherhood.

**3\. Accountability:** Boyz must hold each other accountable for their actions and decisions, especially when they impact the group or an individual boy’s growth. This includes calling out destructive behavior, such as procrastination or unhealthy habits, in a respectful but firm manner.

**4\. Punishment for Violation**: Failing to support a boy’s growth or actively hindering it (e.g., through mockery or sabotage) may result in a group discussion and potential sanctions, such as a formal apology or temporary loss of group privileges.

## **Chapter IV \- The Boyz Panel**

1. Ranking rules \- In a group, we need ranks so that in case of conflicts, higher officials of the group can be reached out for resolution. Rules for rank assignment
   1. Rank is independent from financial, social, emotional status of the boy.
   2. Rank is independent of the age of the boy.
   3. A vote can be cast at any time to change the rank of a boy. All ranks will not be eligible for voting.
   4. Higher rank doesn’t affect the treatment of a boy. Love and brotherhood is shared equally among all ranks.

## **Ranks**

1. **Bh. Mediator**
   - **Role**: Leads conflict resolution, ensuring disputes are handled fairly and transparently. This boy facilitates meetings, moderates discussions, and proposes compromises during loyalty tests or other issues (Chapter V). He is responsible for overall group functioning and making sure all activities are carried out smoothly.
   - **Example Trait**: Steps in to calm a heated group chat argument and suggests a meeting to resolve it.
2. **Bh. Rally**
   - **Role**: Ignites group energy and organizes events, keeping the brotherhood’s vibe alive. They inspire participation in hangouts, football matches, or new adventures, supporting group morale.
   - **Example Trait**: Plans a surprise group outing or hypes everyone for a game night.
3. **Bh. Guide**
   - **Role**: Offers wisdom and support for personal growth, sharing advice or resources to help boyz achieve their goals (Chapter III). They act as a sounding board during tough times.
   - **Example Trait**: Helps a boy with job interview prep or gives advice on handling a breakup.
4. **Bh. Keeper**
   - **Role**: Protects the group’s legacy and well-being, documenting memories (photos, videos) and ensuring everyone’s safety during hangouts. They also check in on quiet members to maintain inclusivity.
   - **Example Trait**: Shares a group photo album after a trip or texts a boy who’s been MIA to check in.

## **Chapter V \- Boyz and the Loyalty Test**

2. Problem: The "You Didn’t Pick My Side" \- If there’s a dispute, loyalty is tested. If one of the boyz feels betrayed by the group’s silence, it can break the trust for good, especially if that situation involves choosing sides.
   1. A formal meeting should be called upon to tackle the issue
   2. The meeting should be attended by both the victim and the culprit
   3. A jury must be there to give a solid judgement on the issue at hand
   4. A compromise must be advised as brotherhood is important and no extreme measures must be taken
   5. If the case is extreme, the boy can be removed from the boyz act if he doesn’t act according to the judgement.

## **Chapter VI \- Boyz and Personal Messages**

3. Problem: External communication happens when a dispute takes place. People start to make groups of who is right and who is wrong and because of this problem escalate. Instead of personal messaging, all talks must take place in the group to ensure transparency.
   1. If a matter has happened in the group, the group members must discuss it in the group
   2. Personal messages are not allowed as this leads to groups
   3. No bad-mouthing must be done in personal messages
   4. All opinions must be shared in the group to ensure transparency
   5. If the dispute escalates we must adhere to Chapter 5 for a meeting

**Chapter VIII \- Boyz When Stoned**

**Problem**: Similar to drinking, being under the influence of substances can lead to behavior that disrupts the brotherhood. Rules must ensure that the group dynamic remains intact.

- **Rule 1: Group Safety**: No boy shall pressure another to partake in substances. Participation is voluntary, and consent must be clear.
- **Rule 2: No Sensitive Discussions**: While stoned, boyz must avoid discussing sensitive topics, such as disputes or personal issues, to prevent misunderstandings.
- **Rule 3: Accountability**: Like drinking, being stoned does not excuse harmful behavior. Any violations must be addressed in a sober meeting, per Chapter V.

**Punishment for Violation**: Pressuring a boy to partake or causing harm while stoned may result in a temporary suspension from group activities or a formal apology.

## Definitions

1. **Boy or Boyz** \- Boy refers to a group member who has agreed to follow this act. Boy is a brother which is not necessarily related by blood. Though we call every member a boy, this act can be followed by the female gender too.

2. **Bh. \-** As in the real world people are given titles like “Mr. & Mrs.” in The Boyz Act we have decided to create a new title for the honourable person who has decided to take up the act for life. From now on, everyone who follows this act will be known as Bh. (name). For ex: If your name is Ayush you will be now known as Bh. Ayush instead of Mr. Ayush. \`
